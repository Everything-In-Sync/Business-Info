Pine n' Dandy Plumbing,"707 S Pinehurst St, Aberdeen, NC 28315, USA",(910) 245-7463,https://callpinendandy.com/,4.9,"Jacob did an excellent job. Very impressed with his professionalism, communication, and knowledge. He talked me through everything he was doing and explained everything in detail…he was so polite during the entire job. Jacob is an excellent ambassador for this company! Truly impressive young man, whose is mature beyond his years. He should absolutely be considered for leadership and/or management positions, such great potential.

I was nothing but impressed with this company, would certainly use again. Labor and material is very expensive these days, but their prices were reasonable. They waived the dispatch fee and gave me a 15% military discount. Overall, very pleased with my experience. I first called the company around 10AM, and job was completed by 4PM. Phenomenal turn-around for a short notice job request!",info@callpinendandy.com

From the initial consultation to the completion of the work, the team was professional, knowledgeable, and efficient.

A special shoutout goes to Landon, who was instrumental in ensuring everything went smoothly. His expertise and attention to detail made a significant difference. He took the time to explain the process, answered all our questions, and kept us informed every step of the way. It was evident that he genuinely cared about delivering quality work and ensuring our satisfaction.

The trenchless technology they employed was not only effective but also minimized disruption to our property, which was a huge relief. The entire team at Thomas Plumbing demonstrated a commitment to excellence, and Landon’s outstanding customer service truly set them apart.

I highly recommend Thomas Plumbing for any plumbing needs, especially if you're considering trenchless solutions. Their professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction are top-notch!",thomas@thomasplumbingnc.com
On Time Plumbing Inc.,"655 S Page St, Southern Pines, NC 28387, USA",(910) 246-0442,https://ontimeplumbingsp.com/,4.9,We would highly recommend Aaron and OnTime Plumbing.  Aaron waws scheduled the next day after I CALLED.  He called us to let us know he was on his way and was prompt and professional in every manner.  He listened carefully to the work we wanted  done and was thorough in assessing the problems.  His estimate arrived within hours of his visit and we are anxious to have him complete the items in the master bath.  Later that afternoon he called to see if we had reviewed the estimate and if we had any questions.  He said he would submit a separate estimate for the work outside.  We would give them very high ratings and recommendations and were very satisfied.,No email found

Doug Smith's Plumbing,"32415 U.S. Rte 1, Aberdeen, NC 28315, USA",(910) 944-8129,,4.3,"Doug Smith Plumbing is the best, period. During the height of covid, our water heater went out. We asked our general contractor here in Moore County who he’d recommend. Without hesitation, he told us Doug’s Plumbing. Doug came out and replaced it same day. Since then, our family has used this company exclusively. Our kids have jammed up our toilets and bathtubs, and every time these folks are on it. They are incredibly responsive. Most recently we had issues with our plumbing, which coincided with my wife giving birth to a third kiddo. Eric came out and did a full inspection and laid out options. Since our house was built in the 60’s we elected for them to replace all of the cast iron and coordinated steel piping under the house. They worked their tail off for a full day. All of our issues were fixed, and they even chopped several hundred dollars off of the original quoted price because they did not need to use as much material as they were thinking the job might need. This company is  one driven by honesty, fair pricing, hard work, responsiveness, understanding, and commitment to the labor and services they provide. My family cannot recommend this company enough if you reside in/around Moore County, NC.",No website
"Adam Harward Plumbing, LLC","186 Hulsey Rd, Carthage, NC 28327, USA",(910) 947-2962,,4.9,"We've had them at our house twice so far. One issue was outdoors and the other indoors.

The outdoor issue had a few options. I was shocked when Adam's recommendation wasn't the most expensive because it wasn't the most effective. His goal was to fix the issue, not bandage it so he could come back.

Even though the indoor issue was straight forward it was notable because his workers came in, immediately diagnosed the problem, fixed it, and left. They were very courteous, polite, and professional.

5/5 would definitely recommend.",No website
