Your employees are amazing that's working this area. In the 2500 block of our road. He has came twice and said that we had to cut your electric off. This is to change out all the piles in the area for this fire fly thing coming though I am sure which is fine because we have nothing. But, this one guy is top notch wonderful personality great with the customers. I didn't get his name but he's tall skinny  wore mirrored sunglasses. Always wondered if I needed the electric for anything be4 they turned it off. Now that is very thoughtful and courteous along with the business mind set.
I give these white truck a number 10 on a 1 to 5 scale they are top notch. REC at least got a good company this time.. thanks Lee electrical for what you all are doing.

As a remodeler I’ve had great experience's with these guys and their employees. On time and done right the first time.  Which hard to find in this trade.

"M.R. Stoner Electric, Inc.","3216 Hawkins Ave, Sanford, NC 27330, USA",(919) 774-8877,http://www.mrstonerelectric.com/,4.8,A storm caused a tree limb to fall on a power line at our home.  It ripped the meter from the house.  We called CEMC and they had to cut the power at 11:00 pm.  I called MR Stoner at 7:45 am the next morning.  The lady that took my call was so nice (Elaine).  She rerouted a job and we had electricians at our home by 9:00 am. They quickly repaired the damage and the price was very reasonable.  Logan and Devon were very polite and did a great job!   If you ever need electrical service call M.R. Stoner.  I am definitely a customer for life!!!!,christian@mrstonerelectric.com
Clark Electrical Contractors,"125 Magnolia Rd, Pinehurst, NC 28374, USA",(910) 295-3415,,4.2,"They wanted to do a major service in our home without giving us even a general quote. It took months for them to get back to me- in the meantime, I was without a stovetop and/or oven that whole time, and getting in touch 2x per week to follow-up. The last time I followed up, it still took 3 weeks to get a quote, though they had forgotten about me. This, however, reminded them that they’d never billed me for the prior service. Got that bill super fast via email. Love that.

They do not take credit card, and I had been away visiting family, so when they called a couple weeks later to follow-up on payment, I told them I would send a check. Just a week later, MaryBeth called again, this time threatening to “pursue further avenues.”

We obviously found help elsewhere.

I do not recommend. Not even a little bit.",No website
