They answer their phones quickly and the phone booking experience was very personable and super professional.

Last year I obtained estimates from another major vendor in the area and the competitor's phone support was sub-optimal in my opinion; the competition also did not offer the all of the services of Air Specialties Heating and Cooling.

I have worked with Andrew for the past 3 years and he is amazing. He presents options and discusses the pros and cons of each option; he makes me fully trust Air Specialties Heating and Cooling. Andrew is very professional and knowledgeable and I recommend working with him.",tom@air-specialties.com,HVAC Contractors,"Aberdeen, NC"

End of the day today, my oldest of 4 boys sends me a picture of our thermostat and it was 86° in our house. The ac went out. Called a different place because it came up on Google first and they said it would be tomorrow before they’d make it out. Called Sunbelt, and within the same hour of placing that call, Anthony pulled up in his van and fixed it in minutes. He was so unbelievably nice, and so understanding. The prices were much better than what we were told with the first place we called. My family is so happy about Sunbelt being able to provide such awesome service. The temp inside had reached 88° when he arrived and it is steadily cooling off. Thank the Lord for this company. You truly saved us today.Anthony is an amazing employee.

Robert the sales rep visited our home and looked at everything and provided us a very reasonable and detailed quote. Several weeks later we decided to go with Carolina Air and when I recontacted Robert, he walked me through all the financing and install options. He advised that we should anticipate a 2 day install. Bryan, a site supervisor came over the day before install and also walked through the inside and outside areas where he crew would need to work. He also went to great lengths to explain what we should expect but said he fully expected his guys to get the job done one 1 day.  Caleb and Eric arrived on schedule, introduced themselves, explained in what order they would do the install and went right to work.  Those 2 were joined by another gentleman and the 3 never took a break. 7:45 am to 3 pm, these guys were quiet professionals and did a phenomenal job, upstairs, downstairs, in the crawl space and outside.  As advertised, they cleaned up and took away all the old equipment and the packing materials.  I 100% highly recommend Carolina Air for quality AC installs.

---

I recently had the pleasure of working with TGU Construction Company on a renovation project for my home and I couldn't be more impressed with the experience. From the outset, the TGU team demonstrated professionalism, expertise, and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.

What set TGU apart was their attention to detail. Every aspect of the project was meticulously planned and executed, ensuring not just functionality but also aesthetic appeal. The team communicated clearly throughout the process, keeping me informed and involved in decision-making, which I greatly appreciated.

One of the highlights of working with TGU was their ability to navigate challenges with creativity and efficiency. Despite encountering unexpected issues during the renovation, they provided solutions that were both effective and cost-efficient, ensuring the project stayed on track without compromising on quality.

The final outcome exceeded my expectations. The quality of workmanship is evident in every corner of my newly renovated home, and the compliments I've received from friends and family are a testament to TGU's exceptional work.

I'm grateful to the entire team at TGU Construction Company for making this renovation journey a seamless and enjoyable experience. Their dedication to their craft and their clients is truly commendable. I highly recommend TGU to anyone  looking for a reliable, skilled, and customer-focused construction company.",info@tguhomesolutions.com,General Contractors,"Aberdeen, NC"

- clear and timely communication
- expertise in craft
- local/family owned
- on time
- on budget

BVH met or exceeded our expectations in all of these categories when previous builders have not. In fact, Bob came in under budget by a decent amount due to his local knowledge and relationships that he has in the building community.
